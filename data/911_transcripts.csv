That's first deal. You give me a lighter, and I'll make it work for you. If that lighter got anything wrong with it, no fluid, then it's over. I'm not making no deals with you. Well, however, if you get a lighter, you're not going to suck. I'm going to run through your fucking cops there and fucking all my ass all day because they had enough speed to catch up to me. They're not trying to hit me because they know they hit me. I'm going to put this bitch with them on purpose. So this is what I want you to do. Do it, sister. I'm not going to do it. You got it. Write it down on paper. I want a fucking riser in here. Soon. I mean, all I'm better is trying to get this guy. So we don't have a phone either to tell you, and we will run this bitch out on any of these. You're supposed to fool. How are we going to get you the lighter if you're not going to talk? Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time. If the lighter's not in here, I'm going to slow down. I'm not going to get off on no fucking exit. I'm adding the cocoa. Before I get the cocoa, I close the cocoa. I want a lighter in here right now. I'm going to put it on my side. If your hands are in here, just put it inside on anything. I'm watching it in there right here. So you've got to put it on the fucking side of my side and drive a side. Talk to me. You want somebody to face you and pull up next to you? That's kind of dangerous. We can't really do that. What are you doing out there? Are you slowing down okay for me? Okay, I didn't tell him whether or not. If he's pulling up, I'm going to slow down for him. If he's out here, if he's busted, I'm killing him. I'm hurting him bad. Okay, I'm hurting him. Tell him, huh? Who are you going to hurt? Nobody. I'm not hurting nobody. I want him out here right now. This is why I'm pulling my mom. If you don't give me this, I'm going to click over and never pick up the phone. Tell that officer to pull up, up here. And never try, if he's trying to, try to do a car, because y'all are going to try to hit me. Bye. I know. Are you still on the phone with me?

We don't know where he's shot at. We don't know if we can do something to help him. Would you be willing to try to get a little bit closer so at least we can tell?

Yeah, we've got deputies on scene. I just need more information. Okay. Do you have any updates at all about we're trying to assess his condition now? Not yet. I don't have any information now. Okay.

Okay, what do you mean not exactly? Did you see the vehicle? I think the vehicle is a white truck, but I'm not sure what it was. Did you see the driver of the vehicle? No, it was many, many feet away. Yeah, it was close. What kind of truck was it? I'm not sure, but I know what it was like. Okay, was it two-door, four-door? Um, I think it was newer. I'm thinking. Did it look newer or older? I'm thinking. I believe it. What do you think? You said you believe what? It was, I believe it was like a new model. I think it was a new model. But I don't know how it knew it was. Okay, did you see anything recognizable about it? Stickers, dents, tinted windows, rims, anything that would help us find it? No, I'm not sure.

Okay. You said there was no tent? I think it was a tent. It's pretty dark back here. Absolutely. Okay, would you be willing to meet with a deputy? Oh, no, I don't think I'm very sure. They just need to get information about what you might have seen so that way they can find this guy. It's really important if you'd be willing to meet with a deputy. It would be really, really helpful. I have to force myself to tell y'all what this happened. I know, and I do appreciate it. We can get this information... You know, we do need to get this information from you, though, so anything that you could possibly tell a deputy just so that way you can tell them what they saw or what you saw. I don't know if this. I'm not sure. They're not going to do anything about you. They're not going to give out your information. They're not going to give your... They're not going to disclose anything about you. Just what we need for us, so that way we can get whatever you saw. I know, I know. What's your name, sir? Sir, may I have your name? If you don't want to meet with a deputy, can we have a deputy call you? We have your phone number already, so... Yes. Okay. What's your name, sir? Yes. What's your name? I guess... This is a lot of pressure right here. I know, and you can trust me. I would not be telling you this information if it wasn't true. No one's going to know you talked to a deputy. It's going to come up as a... unknown number on your phone so no one's even going to be able to see that. We're not going to give any of your information out. It's just really, really important in a situation like this that anyone that has any information about it can give that information to the deputies. So we're not trying to get you in trouble or anything like that or make it look like you, you know, did something that isn't what you want to do. It's just really important. It's a lot, yes. I know.

No, it was the back that happened. a back road off of Holden or off of OBT? No, um, you know the Save-A-Lot side of the line. Uh-huh, so was it behind the Save-A-Lot? Yeah, behind, uh-huh. So did he come out on Rio Grande? So did he come out on Rio Grande, or? No, I'm not too sure. That's, that's, I can't be from United States. Okay. And did you see anything about the driver? Did you see white, black, Spanish, young, old? Anything at all. Any information about him at all? I don't know, man. You had to call me back. Okay, sir, just stay on the phone with me for a little bit longer. You know, I know you said, did he look like he was older? Younger, white, black, any information at all would be helpful.

We are on the ground. We are not moving. We're not moving, but to reiterate, suspect's daughter and grandson are in the conference room with Erica and I. So, and of course, she's highly distraught, and I'm on the phone with 911 right now. I'm just hanging on. I just wanted to see if you guys could share anything with us.

I'm not sure if they are in custody of the suspect yet or not. I'm not sure. Yeah. Well, we are not moving. We are on the ground. But just to repeat, the suspect's daughter and grandson are in the room with us. And we're doing everything we can to try and keep her calm. But obviously she's strong. Absolutely. I understand. But our concern is that Maybe trying to get into this building. I don't know. Okay. How old is his daughter? I don't know. I don't know. She's probably... You can ask her.

Okay, I'm being advised that you should stay where you are for the time being. And I'll keep you online. Okay, okay, we're not moving. And I'll keep you updated. Yes, one moment. Who was in that room with you, Fredster? By yourself. I know what you're thinking, that they've asked everyone to go to the cafeteria, but they've told us to stay in here because I don't know if anyone's been subdued or apprehended. And shots were fired right outside this building. It's not your fault. Just stay there, and we need to wait to make sure the coast is clear. We don't want anyone hurt. We don't want anyone hurt. And did you say her name was Jean Wells? Walls. Walls, I apologize. W-A-L-L-S. Okay. I guess I'm highly distraught. Right now she doesn't know.

Bullets in your office? I was in that room. I'm glad I came in here. Hi, are you there? Yes, I am. Our shots were definitely fired into this building, multiple shots. Okay.

I just want to know if we can, when it says to move. Yeah, I'll let you know. I'm sure just your presence there with her is calming. Do you need a telephone? Just a moment. They have asked. They made an announcement, what, about ten minutes ago for anybody still on campus to move towards the cafeteria.

The shots have definitely been fired into this building. Our behavior resource teacher, whose office is right next to this room, she just peeked out. She says, you know, there's at least a couple bullet holes in her windows. Okay. And that was the building that I was, I mean, that's the room that I had initially called from 911. Was it you that I talked to? Yes, it was. Okay, because I had a real bad connection, which was probably part of the problem you were having. That's why you were breaking up on me, so I don't know how much of what I was saying you could hear. Yeah, we had some kind of beeping on the line at that time. I don't know what it was. But just to clarify, the room that I originally called 911 from, we're in the room next door right now. There's only one window in here, and I'm right under it. But lots of windows in the other room. That's why I kind of transitioned into here, and that's where shots were fired. And that's in the office of the building you're in right now, correct? the bullet holes that you're speaking of were in the office of the building that you are in right now? Yeah, they were into this building, not the room that we are in right now. There's about five different rooms in this building. Approximately, yeah, there's one, two, three, four, five.

As long as it's law enforcement coming to us, we're fine with that. Absolutely, absolutely. Would you be at liberty to share with us wounded on campus? I'm not, but I honestly don't know any of that yet because it's all on silent lines right now, traffic. It's our only concern right now. I understand. Our dispatching is separate from our call-taking. We're all in the same building, but we don't hear the radio traffic from where I'm sitting, so I get my updates directly from dispatch.

I robbed somebody downtown Portland at Nice Point, and I'd just like to let you guys know that I did that, and I'm about to commit suicide. I'm standing on a 10-story high building. Okay, where at? I don't want to release that information. I just would like to let you guys know that there's any... You're not going to tell me where you are and why are you calling me? Because I'd like to let you guys know that I... She made a robbery, and you guys need to clean my body up here soon. Okay. What's your name? Brad Morgan. Is there anybody we should call to let them know? I'd like you to contact Karina Bartley, but, you know, it's up to you guys. Okay. Do you have a phone number for this person? She ain't going to answer the phone. I've been trying to contact her. Okay. Who's this person to you? She's my ex-girlfriend. How long ago did she become your ex-girlfriend? About three weeks ago. Okay. And you're going to jump off the building because of that or because of some other reason? I've gotten myself into a lot of trouble lately, and my girlfriend took my son from me and denies my visiting time. I've tried going to the courts and working things out. My life is just shitty anyways, so I feel that I no longer need to live. Okay. And that's your final decision? There's no way I can talk you out of that? No. I just would like to let you guys know that, you know, just for a heads up what's going on. Okay. Tell me her name again. I didn't write it down quickly enough. Karina Bartley. What is her phone number? Um, hold on one second. It's 503-839-839. Um, 839-3689. 839-3689? Correct. This is the ex-girlfriend who's the mother of your child? Yeah. How old's your child? Um, he's eight months old. It seems too bad that you're not going to get to see him and talk to him when he's older, don't you think? Um, I'd try to be in jail if I would have passed it anyway, so. He'd still prefer you were alive? So he has a dad? Um, he probably would, but, you know, I'm thinking past that right now. I just, you know. Okay. How did you get up to the building there? Did you walk or did you drive? Um, I don't have a vehicle, so I walk. Okay. And you're just on top of, like, somebody's business or a parking structure or what? Um, I'm on top of a backstory building. Okay. Right, like a parking structure or like somebody's business, or what kind of building are we talking about? It's a parking structure, and I've got a visual view of Pioneer Square. Why don't you talk to me just a little bit longer before you do anything you can't take back? I know I can't take it back once I do it, and I really am debating on doing it or not, but I... Well, you know what? I'm going to give you a really great deal. Are you ready for this? What? This is a one-time only deal, and only from me. I will believe everything you tell me on this phone call. My girlfriend broke up with me because we got into a little argument. She told the police officer that I hung up the phone while she was trying to make a police report, and that's why I got arrested. I sat in jail for four days and got a restraining order while I was in there. When was that? Was that a long time ago? No, just recently. Okay. And the cop wouldn't believe me because of my record. And that's why I went to jail. Well, if that's what she said, you tell me what really happened. Tell me your side. I was trying to leave with my son. She took my son from me, so I took him back and pushed her away from the door because she was trying to hold me in our apartment. Not, like, shoved her, but, like, put my hand on the doorknob and, like, elbowed her away a little bit. And then I started proceeding down to the max to get on the max for my parents. She slid down a sheriff that was driving by, just so happened. And she gave him her side of the story and I gave him mine. And the only reason he arrested me is because I hung up the phone on the police call. I understand that was a bad thing at the time, but it got me arrested and made it so I couldn't see my son even longer than I was supposed to, you know? And then after that, my girlfriend says, you can call and talk to your son. And when I call, I talked to my son, she called the police and says I'm contacting her, and now they want to arrest me for that. Okay, was there like a no contact order or something? Yes. Okay. And on top of that, I was supposed to get... And then she called the police when you did, yeah? Yes. Okay. And then... I feel that I no longer need to live, that she's putting me down every which way she can. I have nobody besides her. Well, hang on just a second. So the initial calling to no contact order, did that come from the judge after this hang-up-the-phone incident? It came from the judge, yes. Because that's a temporary thing for now. I mean, that's not an irrevocable, you're never going to see your son again thing. have to work through the system and write it out for a little while. That's the problem. I've been going through the system my whole life and I'm tired of it. Most of the time it wasn't even my fault. And I've just done some bad things in my life and I feel that this is the consequence for it. Well, doing bad things, I mean, everybody does bad things, but what you need to do is grow, become better because of it. Not just end your life. That's cheating, don't you think? I mean, you have to, you get to suffer the consequences of what you did. I mean, you know that. You're telling me that yourself. But then you learn and you become a better man for it. You know, I appreciate the sweet talk. I really do. You know, it feels good to actually be able to talk to somebody funny. Yeah? Well, I'm not blowing smoke. I really believe that. Nobody gets to suffer the consequences of what they do, but you get to be better. You get to choose to be better and do better. That's the problem. When I try to choose to be better and do better, it just cracks her back down on me. Well, you said you don't have anybody but her, or have you tried to get help? I mean, I assume there's some other thing. You said you've been working with the system for a long time, so I'm guessing you're not. Well, like I said, I've had a criminal background. Right. I'm going with the wrong crowd and the wrong things that we shouldn't have done. Okay, well, you admit that you took responsibility for making best choices, excellent, but you don't have to stay there forever. You're not stuck there forever. You get to choose to be different. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm choosing to finish it. Everybody dies. That doesn't make you different. You want to be a better man, not a dead man. Your son needs you to be a better man. Well, the reason why I'm really mad is she's posting on Facebook and making it visible for me to see that she's basically with another guy. I feel the whole reason that she even did this whole ordeal was to get the domestic violence grant. And now on top of that, I took care of my son the whole first eight months last year, and she's claiming him on the taxes. So I don't, you know, I don't need any... Is she going to move into her own place? Yeah, it sounds like you're not exactly getting a fair deal there. I would agree. But just removing yourself from the equation, that doesn't hurt her, you know? I mean, I'm not recommending you stay alive so you can make her pay. That's not what I mean at all. What I mean is you're punishing yourself for crap she's doing. Don't do that. Well, I feel that I was part of it. I'm not blaming it all on earth. Of course, you have done your share. Everybody agrees, it sounds like you've done your share, but you don't have to stay there. You don't have to keep making choices that put you in that same situation. Yeah, but even on top, there's the little things that I've done. She even got my cousin against me, and she has the cops You know, on their side, no matter what the fuck I do or say. You know, I mean, I've been fighting the courts and the police my whole life, and I'm tired of it. Like, honestly, I feel like shooting one of them right now. Well, don't do that. First of all, Brad, the police are in the area looking for you because they want to talk to you, too. They don't want you to be dead on the pavement. This is the second time I've attempted to commit suicide, and honestly, I think this is going to be the final time. Okay, well, please, please don't. The police are asking. You'll tell me what you're wearing so they can find you and help you. I'm wearing a red backpack and a hoodie. What color? Black with red on the front. Do you have any guns on you since you mentioned shooting? Possibly. Police officer to shoot me at this point. I'm not looking forward to anything. I hope pretty good because that's what they do for a living. No, it isn't what they do. Have you ever watched cops and seen what they do? Yes, I have. Have you ever been in my footsteps where you're being beat by a nightstick and down in the back of the park? No. They do not want to shoot you. They don't want to kill you. They don't want to take your life. I want to take one of their lives. I honestly do. And, you know, the same cops been circling around this building, like, didn't know how to get in or something. How did you get in? I walked up the stairs. On what side? On that side, besides the max. That would be a bad outcome, right? That would make me sad. Yeah, it would make me very, very sad. Because I've been talking to you, you know? You've never met me, I've never met you, but we've talked and you've told me some personal stuff, and even a little bit, I feel like I know you just a little bit, and it would make me sad. I'm a good person, you know, I can try to be, and I try to be. But no matter which way I put it, I just want my girlfriend, she's pushing me away. She's telling me how happy she is with the other guy or whatever. And it's not, it doesn't feel good. So, you said that she's posting on Facebook, but she's blocked you. How did you know about the Facebook thing if she blocked you? Because I have that have her as a friend, and I'm on their Facebook. Okay, so I don't know how Facebook works. Does that mean you can see her again? I can see her posts through another person. Oh, I gotcha. Okay. And on top of that, she deleted me and then wrote on there, I'm done with you. Leave me alone. It's like, what do you mean you're done with me? You've got the kid and the other. You know, it was a plan. You couldn't see anything. How long were you guys together? Like two and a half years, maybe three years. And so, let's see, so like a year in you guys decided to have a baby? My kid's only eight months old. How old are you? He's 21. My mom actually wanted me to have a kid because she has heart problems and she wanted to be around for it. And she's putting my mom through not being able to see any of her. And it makes me feel like shit because I feel like it's my fault. At the same time, I have a feeling that she was dating somebody behind my back and then obviously wanted to be with them or something. She wrote on the Facebook, you know, oh, thanks for the great night. And then the next post was, I want my pants back. It's like, dude, come on, you fucking hoe. You have a kid and all you want is sex now from other people? It's not fucking right at all. I can't stand the fact that there's going to be another person as my jump spotter figure. I mean, if we needed to, could we have him come down? She lives in Gresham. I was just on the roof spying on him. I was trying to see my son, but the dog kept barking, so I believed. All I wanted to do was get a vision with my son. It's not right at all. Well, what I wondered was... On top of that, it's like, you can go down to the courthouse and get a restraining order on somebody, and now you can't contact them. It's like, come on, really? Did you actually get served with a restraining order? Yes, this is my second time. The first time, she was fine. She was happy with me. She says, oh, I'll see you later. The next thing I know, there's a sheriff at my door serving me with a restraining order. find out that she gets $400. And then on top of that, like, I'm trying to make up with her because I love her and I just want to be with her and be a family. And then she comes back with me. And I have an apartment with my roommate. And I was basically kicked out of there. And she stayed there for maybe another week and then moved out, left my roommate high and dry. And then work things out with her, and I was trying to make it back right with my roommates, and we go back over there, and next thing I know, she's pulling it all over again, and I honestly don't feel that it's right at all. Is she older than you? No, she's younger. She's playing with me and she's having fun and I'm not going to let her do it anymore. Well, I would say this is not the way to make it stop. The police officers found me finally. Okay. Would you do me a big huge favor? Please, please, please. Don't do anything rash. Don't make them hurt you. Put your hands up and go talk to them and let them help you. Let them get you to a counselor or whatever. I'm cool with that. Okay. Please. No, I'm not leading with these officers. I'm definitely not going to lead with these officers. I'm done going to that jailhouse. I'm done being treated like a rag doll. Tonight, this is what you're doing with me. It's not a crime. These cops are not going to be able to reach me. I was like a monkey and got to where I'm at. They're not going to get to me. The same thing for you I want. They want to see me jump. They'd get a kick out of it. Nobody wants to see you jump. Have you ever seen a jumper? I have. It's horrid. It's awful. I've never seen one, but I imagine it's going to be a quick painful death. This is how bad of a person I am. I seen a guy come off of an ATM, and I walked up to him with my knife and said, give me the money, and he handed it to me. And the police officer drove past like two seconds afterward. He could have stopped it, but he didn't notice. And the guy didn't shout out for help, luckily. And the first homeless person I seen, I gave all the money to. So you didn't even keep the money? No, I gave it away. while you took the money, if you were gonna keep it? I was walking up to the top of the building and seeing a homeless guy laying there on the road, and it was helpful, and you know, he took him and probably kicked him out. Okay, and so then when you saw the opportunity, you took the money and went back to him? Yeah. I'm sorry for it, but You know, I don't know what overcame me, but I felt that it was right. And that's the problem with me. I feel things are right, and I do it, and most times the mistakes. Well, it sounds to me like you need to talk to a counselor to help you sort out good choices from bad rap. You know? I've tried talking to people. I've tried getting help. I wanted to go and sit down with the media or whatever trying to make things work, you know? Well, here's something else for you to consider. If you go ahead and do the things like go to anger management with or without her, and you can show a judge that you are making these efforts because you want to be the father of the boy, I already know that I've already done fucked up just by coming up here and calling you. I'm not going to be able to see my son after this. Do you really think they're going to let somebody from that point and say, well, she's not happy or something like this? Maybe not like this minute, no. But what I'm saying is you can still get help and straighten yourself out, and then it'll be obvious from the things that you've done to a judge who's going to make the decision that you're making an effort to straighten yourself out. I've already tried that. I've already tried that. They don't believe me. They don't believe me. It's my record. I'm telling you. That's probably part of it, but what I'm saying is you've got to make an effort over time and watch, you know, so up to now you've made bad choices, and that's what they're looking at. From now forward, you make good choices so they can look at that. You know, honestly, I really do appreciate your high talkingness. It's kind of making me feel better, but honestly, I've already fucked up by coming up here and doing what I've done. I've already fucked up. Okay. Don't make it worse by hurting yourself. I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm going to provoke the police to do it, or I'm going to jump off after that doesn't work. Where's the knife you used earlier? In my pocket. I'm far enough on the edge to fall. I'd appreciate if you'd just go give up to the police. I know you would. I would almost appreciate it, too. But the thing is, I know what they're going to take me. I know what they're going to do to me. And it's not going to make my girlfriend love me. Well, it sounds to me she's this busy messing with you that maybe she's not very and you're better off without her. But, you know, that's not my decision. That's your decision. I probably am better off without her. That's what my dad says. I love you. Yeah, and I know. How you feel is how you feel. There's nothing you can do about that. I get that. I do. And you're kind of tied to her for life anyway because she is the mother of your child. Yeah. You know, we wanted to be a family. We agreed to each other that we were going to, no matter what, stick together. You know, we're going to fucking argue that she just fails out. And then already with somebody else. Like, come on, dude. The fact of me knowing that my girlfriend is sleeping with somebody else, it makes me want to kill the other person. Yeah. And then if I'm her, but that's real. Then I'm just going to kill myself and not let off to deal with it no more. Well, but those aren't your only options. Yeah. You're talking like that's your only option if somebody has to die. The police are trying to talk to me. I'll let you go."

I don't think I would have just placed it. How far down are you? Well, there's like a little three handles, but I don't think I'm able to get up. Maybe four feet. You're 12 feet under? Yeah, and there's like a hand, you know, kind of hand ripped to the side, but I don't know if I'm able to get up here, but I don't know. Hold on a second. What is your name? Hold on a second. OK. What is your name? OK. Can you repeat your name again, please? What? There's like a wood, you know, like a crate thing. You know, there's all things in it. Okay. All right, so you're walking north on Hicks. Did you notice the fire department next to you? Because I see you're by the Calatine Firehouse. Are you there? Hello?

Are you injured? I think I scraped myself a little bit. I'm down in the manhole. I'm down about four feet down, and I don't think I've been trying to grab a hold of the handholds, but it's kind of wobbly here. So you're four feet under? Yeah, three or four feet. And I'm trying to figure out how, you know, there's like a crate thing. you know, those flat things over. Well, it's all through, but it's like, it's all over across the open. Fell through a crate? How big is that crate that you're speaking of? Well, it's like one of those, oh boy, one of those flat things, you know. Like what color is it, the crate? It's a Okay, just stay on the phone with me. We do have help on the way. Our phone line's breaking up. It's going in and out. Yeah, I guess it's north of the fighter station. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I see on my map that you're just north of there, off of Hicks Road, so. It must have been walking. I don't know how the Hicks I managed to fall down because the, you know, the flat things you put over, it's still in place. It's still in place? Okay. Yeah, it's still in. Oh, ma'am, what side of the street were you walking on when you were going on Hicks? Were you on the sidewalk close to the firehouse? Are you there? Yeah. Oh, what side of the street were you walking on? Like on the firehouse side or the other side? around the back of the part of the firehouse. By the firehouse? There's a place where you can, there's a driveway here, and I I'm sitting here. Let me know when the fire department gets to you. But it's still in place. I'm trying to figure out how the heck I got down here. Okay. So you're walking on the firehouse side? Like that sidewalk? Yeah. I used to come around and be asked was there, and I see some of my candy. Also, there's an infinite crate. Do you remember crossing Dundee Road? No. I ended up down here because there's a lot. Quet, crate thing, slats. OK. Did you pass the firehouse? I did. Yeah, okay. But you did not reach Dundee Road yet? I'm trying to stand up, but I don't see anything. Okay. Now, were you walking, like, on a grassy area or, like, a path or a sidewalk? No, I was just going to the firehouse on here. I was cutting through behind those businesses. And, uh... Okay. It's still in place, but I'm trying to figure out... It's still in place, but you fell in? I'm sorry. It's still in place, the crate thing, and you still fell in there? Okay. Ma'am? Yes? Were you walking on, like, a grassy area or a sidewalk? I was cutting through, you know, between the firehouse on our ship. And then there's a drive lane that comes around just north of there. I was cutting through there. So was it a, were you on pavement or were you on land, like grass or? It's coming over to the shopping planner and it's coming around and it's right away in the north of the firehouse I'm here. And right above my head, it looks like it's still in place almost.

No. The teacher that came in here did not tell me that at all. OK. I mean, he was pretty shaken, I'll be honest. So it must be kind of serious. Do you know where in the building he's at, other than the third floor? No. All I know is third floor. We're not a real big building, so OK. We have any idea if anybody's injured, anything like that? He did not say that, so I would say probably not. Did anyone see him? I did say you saw him with the gun. He said, yes, the students have seen him. So I don't know what that means either. I know I'm just in a lot of help. No, no. How many guns? No, he just said a gun. I'm sorry. We just moved quick to get this locked down. Where is the teacher that saw him? He took off back out, I guess, to go upstairs. Okay. He's one of our, he's like an administrator. He's our director of guidance. And so you did hear shots or somebody did hear shots? I did not. I did not. So I don't know if somebody did or not. He came down. Yeah, I mean, he's not, I know he's for real. He came flying in here and he said, lockdown, call 911 right now. And he got on the PA and said, Everyone were on lockdown at this moment. Follow the lockdown procedures immediately or something like that. And then the principal came out and said, what's going on? And Tom said, there's somebody upstairs with a gun, and they're shooting. That's all I know. But I never heard it. I don't know. And I'm just one floor below. OK. I've got police officers responding. I've went ahead. We've got a life squad going as well, a fire apparatus. OK. I hear sirens now. What entrance do you want them to use the front door? They can come in the front door, and I'll let them in. OK. Okay. All right, I'm just going to keep you online until they get there. Okay, I can hear them. I think they're pulling in right now.

Yeah, they're here. They're at the door. Okay, if you don't feel safe going out there, then... No, I'm okay with that. Actually, I think they're coming in. I think they're coming in.

Are you in a specific runway? I don't know the runway. Italy just ran out of the airplane. What kind of airplane were you in? Uh, Asiana Airlines. Asian? Asiana. Okay. Uh, there's a bunch of fire trucks and a couple ambulances. There's one or two, but there's a lot of people hurting on the ground and we probably need people. My name is Fang Duong. Okay, and you don't know what runway you're in? Uh, I do not know the runway we're on. I see FFP, but I'm looking around trying to see something, but I don't really see anything else. Okay, where are you at on the runway? Uh, in field. You're in a field? Yeah, we're in the middle of the runway. I can see the main station, but I really don't know much more.

Are you actually trapped, or it's just that people haven't gone down the slide? No, no. Most people have gone down the slide, and I think there's some people going into the plane now. Why are people going back into the plane? The emergency crews. Oh, I misunderstood. Okay. But the passengers are all slowly getting off the slide? I think the majority, maybe 99%, I don't know if there's anyone still in there, but the majority of people are out of their airplane. Okay. And again, I'm sorry, I don't know, I just want to make sure that I understand. It's not that they're trapped, they just haven't gotten off. They're not trapped, exactly. I think almost everyone is out. I don't think anyone is trapped. Unless someone got hurt in there and they're trying to get them out or something like that. Okay. And do you know about how many passengers are still on board? When I was leaving, there was only a handful. So I'm assuming almost everyone got out. I see all the stewardesses and the crew members are sliding down now. Okay. What kind of a plane is that? I know that they're already there. Asianic plane. Let me just pull out my boarding test. It's okay if you don't have that. I mean, are you in a place where you are, first of all? Yeah, we're out. We're way past the field. Everyone's at least 100 yards out. I see an area that says monitor 120.5. What are you looking at? I see a sign that says monitor 120.5. Uh-huh. And that's pretty much all I see. I see FFP. A couple of construction trucks. No, that's okay. I was wondering what kind of an aircraft that was. I don't know. Hello? Hello, California Patrol. Hi, we are at the San Francisco International Airport and we just got in a plane crash and there are a lot of people that need help. So there's any way the ambulance can be sent. Are you with a lot of the ambulances that are there? No, they are not. We have people over here who weren't found and they're burned really badly. Where are you at? We're out on the outskirts. We're not towards the airport itself, but we're more out on the field where planes are landing. Okay, stay on the line. Let me get you over to medical, okay? Okay, we need... Hold on. They're going to need to know where you are, though, because the outskirts doesn't help. Try to find a direction of where you're at, okay? Okay, okay. Ambulance emergency number 112. What's the location of the emergency? 112. We're at the San Francisco International Airport. Okay, where's the airport? Do you need help? Yes, we just got in a plane crash, and there are a bunch of people who still need help, and there's not enough medics out here that need help. There is a woman out here on the street, on the runway, who is pretty much burned very severely on the head, and we don't know what to do. Okay, we do have help started that way. You said that they're there, but there's not enough people, correct? Yes, she is severely burned. She will probably die soon if we don't need any help. We are working on getting additional ambulances to you. Confirm for me the phone number that you're calling from, please. 831. Oh, what's the phone number? 234-4681. Okay. She needs help.

Now, they're walking up there. They're following your quadrux, so I didn't know if you went left or right. Yeah, well, the quad, I think he trashed the quad. I found that he had a bloody saw, my pruning saw in his hand when I found him. But anyway, yeah, they just need to follow the road up on top of the hill and get up here as quick as they can, okay? Deborah, hold on. Guys, stop for a second. I know that this is scary, and I appreciate you guys being so cooperative here. Deborah, do you know where he's talking about? I do.

Okay, you do, okay? Okay, please. All right, bye-bye. Is he cooperative with you? Yes. And you have your weapon there, right? Yes, I do. When we come up, do us a favor and just make sure you're following all the commands that we tell you. We'll probably tell you to drop the gun and all that. Absolutely. No problem. But I'll notice he's only 20 feet from me, so let's not drop it and have him pick it up. Perfect. No, yeah, we'll take care of that when we get there. Okay, sounds good. So we're going to leave from the house on foot towards you. Okay? It sounds like that's the best way to get to you. That is the best way, yes. And we're taking those logging roads and the trails out there, and your wife knows how to get to you. Yeah, she can guide you right to me. Okay, perfect. We'll be there as soon as we can. Okay, thank you. I'm going to go ahead and disconnect then, okay? Are you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Okay, good. I'm letting them know that you can hear them and see them. Okay. Okay, blow the whistle right now every 20 seconds. Okay. You copy? Every 20 seconds, blow the whistle. All right. Do you hear anything, Jeff? All right. I'm going to hang out. Bye. They're here. Okay, great. Police are here. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much. You take care, okay? Yes. Okay. Okay. understand. I think, I think I just kind of want to stand back. Okay. That's okay. Yeah.

I have no idea, but it looks like a rifle of some kind. There's no other people over there. I don't know if he's into hunting or something, but I don't think you're allowed to shoot your gun right there in your yard, are you? I'm taking a lot of calls on it.

He just keeps popping them off. He does appear to be in his front yard. Okay. What's going on now, ma'am? I haven't heard anything for maybe a minute. Okay. I don't see him behind his house. Okay.

But he wants a cell phone, and he's getting upset that he doesn't have one. Okay, hold on one second. Did his cell phone die? Because I thought he had a cell phone. Hold on one second. She was talking about the cell phone dying or something, but he needs a cell phone. He has a mother that works at a restaurant, I think, and she's a waitress there. I don't know the name of it, so I don't know if he wants to talk to her or what. So does he want the police to give him a cell phone? He wants a cell phone. Nick called me up and she said he wants a cell phone. Why can't he get a cell phone? And she was very agitated. She's trying to work with Eric to get him a cell phone. Okay. So somehow she's looking for a cell phone and he may be getting antsy if he doesn't get it. Okay. Okay. And he didn't use her cell phone? I'm just asking. I don't know. She's using her cell phone to talk to me. Right. So he knows that, does he know that you're in contact with her? I don't know. All right. I have no idea. I would assume that he does. Okay.

I don't know the address, but if he wants a cell phone, I don't know who he wants to call. I'm assuming it's his mother, but I... Okay. All right, I'm going to let the officers know. I don't know if they're able to give him a cell phone. I don't know how the process works or what their plans are for that, but I definitely let them know that...

So she said her friend is about to die. Right. And... Pacing back and forth. And the ex-boyfriend is pacing back and forth. Did she say where? the basement, and then she told me that he shot at her mom, which I already knew. Okay. Now is this just recent?

Okay, when did you get the information about her phone's going to die and the ex-boyfriend's pacing back and forth? About 20 minutes ago. Okay. Okay. And she also said that the subject, when he shot at her mother, do you know if this was before or after he shot someone else? Okay, so he said she shot at. Did he say that he actually shot her? No, shot at. Okay. And I also heard that someone else told me that, too. A friend that talked to somebody, I don't know. Okay, I want to know the information, though, that's coming from her to you. Okay. Not from somebody else. Shot at. Okay. Okay. Here's your callback number in case the officers need to speak with you. Okay. And where do you reside? I live in Palatine. Okay. Well, okay.

Representative Bogdanov, you're on deck. Representative Domino is here to talk about emergency dispatchers, 911 dispatchers. Welcome to Health Care Council. You're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. This bill upon passage will allow for a certification process for emergency dispatchers. Currently, 31 other states have such a process, it will recognize a 208 hour DOE approved course as a minimum standard. The goal, of course, is to ensure that first responders are dispatched to emergencies and catastrophic events with a higher level of quality and efficiency while minimizing human errors and mistakes. Our emergency dispatchers, by and large, do a great job, but by having all 67 county people doing the same thing, it will be helpful. And I will shorten my introduction because we have some rather dramatic testimonies to the need for this legislation. Very good. Members, are there questions of Representative Domino on the bill? Is there questions? Let's go to public testimony. Representative Domino, did you want to call folks in any particular order or just as they? Most of them are. Okay, very good. Randy Touchton. Very good. Thank you so much, Randy. Florida Professional Firefighters Association waves in support. Armand Nault. Firefighters. Very good. Firefighters. And you're from Lake Worth, Florida. Thank you so much for coming forward. Firefighters and paramedics of Palm Beach County. Gary Rainey. Gary Rainey, thank you so much from Miami, Florida. The Florida Professional Firefighters. Lisa Henning. Lisa is with the Fraternal Order of Police right here in Tallahassee. She is a proponent of the bill. Richard Goff. Morning. Richard, good morning. Welcome. Glad to have you here. I'm a 25-year law enforcement veteran with the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office and the father of Denise Amberley. My daughter was kidnapped, raped, murdered from her house in Northport. where her two children are at home, her two-year-old and her six-month-old, my grandbabies. As a result, a guy drove her down the road. She was able to get the attention of a bystander in a car at a traffic light by beating and screaming in the car. Bystander called 911 to my office, where I actually work, and to the dispatch, and they took the call. Lady gave the description of the car, the vehicle, the suspect, Describe my daughter as being younger than what she was. All she could see is a hand slapping in the car and screaming like she's never heard a scream. She even asked if there was an Amber Alert out on a person that day. As a result, our dispatch, my dispatch where I work, forgot to dispatch the call to road deputies out there, which we had over six agencies out there looking for my daughter that day, two helicopters, canine, and approximately 30 people out there on the street looking for her. She was found later buried in a shallow grave, shot in the head. We had cars on the road waiting to apprehend the guy right where she was at. But they never dispatched the car. On behalf of my daughter, I'd like to see this bill pass. And there was an internal investigation done, found that the two girls were at fault. My boss gave one five days off and one three days off. family wasn't real happy with that either. Thank you. Richard Goff, thank you very much. Our heart truly goes out to you and your family. I am sorry you have to be here and testify and give that story. That is a horrible story. Amy Campbell. Very good. Amy is from Orlando, Florida, and she represents the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and she waves in support. Richard Penske. Very good. Richard, you're from West Palm Beach, and you represent 911 emergency dispatchers. Thank you all for coming. Is there anyone else wishing to publicly testify on House Bill 997? Members will go into debate. Is there any debate? Yes, sir. Back here. Very good. I'm sorry. Representative Hayes, you're recognized in debate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Excuse me. I am deeply disturbed that this is only a voluntary certification. I'm sure Representative Domino has a reason for that, but I would like to see us look in the future at making it mandatory that The people who are answering these phone calls and are charged with dispatching units to respond are properly trained and have passed a certification test. I think this voluntary just doesn't go far enough. And I share your sentiments toward the story of Sergeant Goff and his family, and there are many others that perhaps need our support as well. But I would certainly like for us to look in the future making this a mandatory certification. Representative Harrell, in debate. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And my heart also goes out to Sergeant Goff on the loss of your daughter. an example of why training is so, so important. Especially in healthcare things, not just law enforcement. Law enforcement is absolutely essential, they have that training. But I know running the Health Quality Committee that when 911 is called, more often than not, it's not a police issue, it's a health issue. training for those dispatchers so that they understand how to handle that person who is often panicked dealing with someone who is helping someone having a heart attack, having a baby, or in an accident. So I think this is absolutely essential, and I will agree with Dr. Hayes. I think that this, Representative Hayes, I think this needs to become the standard across the state and be required. Representative Hudson in debate. Thank you, Chairman. Sergeant Goff, as a parent, I'm just speechless at your testimony. It was powerful and I can't imagine what you must be feeling. This is a great bill. I think the consistency of process is enormously important. We cannot have 67 different versions for 67 different counties of how we go about this process. Our first responders deserve better when they go out into the field, be it sheriff or firefighters or paramedics, to make sure that they're ensuring the public safety. And that consistency of processing good information in and good information out is going to save lives, and I support this bill. Additional debate members, Representative Anderson in debate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to compliment Representative Domino for bringing this bill forward. It's a very important issue, communication and getting the word out. And I also support the comment made by the other representative that maybe at some future time this should be a requirement. Thank you. Representative Domino, you recognize the close. Well, the members have closed perhaps better than I. I might point out in 28 states it is mandatory and some voluntary. I think for those of us that did watch the basketball game last night, you can do things under stress, make free throws that sometimes under stress you can't. And it's important, as the representative said, that you have a heads up in medical emergencies if the 9-11 dispatchers are all talking the same language and using the same protocol so the treatment can be better when you get there. So this is an important bill that will save lives and very much help in emergency situations. I urge your support. Very good, and thank you very much, Representative Domino, for bringing this bill forward. The clerk will now call the roll on House Bill 997. Representative Anderson. Yes. Osley. Yes. Cusack. Yes. Galvano. Yes. Garcia. Yes. Gibson. Yes. Grimsley. Yes. Harrell. Yes. Hayes. Yes. Hooper. Yes. Hudson. Yes. Petronas. Yes. Porth. Yes. Roberson. Yes. Swartz. Yes. Skidmore, Zapata, Bean. Yes, and by your votes, House Bill 997 will be reported favorably as a council substitute with your permission, Representative Domino. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, members. Thank you very much."

Sir, Larry, you have no way of making contact with them? No, no way to make contact with them. Lake Shore dead ends, okay? When you go that way, it dead ends. It dead ends there and you think that they're down there? Yes, and when you go the up, they go down there and they turn around and go the other way. When we lost contact, we went and went the other way. There's no trace of newspapers. You go the other way where they begin, there's traces of newspapers until you get to that big old hole.

And you said you're at the 34th shell, right? Yes, ma'am. At the 29th shell? Yep. Okay. Do you see where a car went in there or no? No. You know, the water runs out to the river, right? Okay. Out to the Lake Michigan. When you get to that point, there's nothing. The road's gone. Okay. Okay. So, you know, if the cars fell off in there or drove on it, the ground wouldn't be under until you would just drop off. We had no lights. We got flashlights now, but if I go back there, I don't have a signal. Okay. So I can't talk to you from there. Okay. I understand, okay? I know you're upset and frustrated. We're just trying to get their proper information, okay, to get to my officers, okay? When did you make contact with them last? It's been a couple hours. A couple hours? Yes, it's been a long time.

Nobody, they didn't want to talk to him all night, and they got two phones. He had one in his pocket, and she had a two-way, two different types of phones. And so we decided to go look for him, and I was taking him back to the house to get another car. We went down right for her, and that's what we found. When he turned left, There ain't no boxes. Ain't no customers been done. You turn right, and it's a dead-end road. I mean, you go down there, and you follow their path that they would pay, and it leads you to that hole. Okay. You said they would have been in a green Saturn? Yes. If you can get an officer here, I can show them where it's at. Okay. What are their names? Carissa Green and Dean Bowen. Taylor? Taylor. Dean Taylor. Dean Taylor and Clarissa what? Uh, Clarissa Green. Okay. What kind of color are you in, Larry? I'm in a, I'm in a, um, I'm in a Ford F-150. What color? Uh, silver.

Okay, hang tight there. I'm gonna get somebody over to you, okay? You know, we really think this is an extreme emergency. Okay, I understand, sir, okay? And you're going to be on that phone. Yeah, but actually we would like to go back down there because we have some flashlights and see if they're down there. Okay, I don't want you to go back down there if there's a lot of flooding and things like that. I don't want you to put your phone in there, sir. No, no, no. If you can go right to the hole and look, there ain't no flooding, ain't no water on the road, just if I washed it out, but it's pitch black. You can't see nothing. And, like, we were thinking, me and Michael said, man, there was a tree laying on the other side, and we're wondering if they drove up to the tree, stopped, and they did the road class. Okay. So the water, the roadway has just been, like, washed out? Yeah, the road's gone. That's how we're wondering. They're going to wash out the dirt from under the concrete. They stopped to the tree and fell in. Okay. Does that make sense to you? So you think the road's washed out and that they went down there? Say that again? There's a tree that fell right on the other side. We're thinking they drove up to the tree and stopped. And when they did, you know, because the dirt washed from under the road, because the concrete wouldn't just fade in most of the time. So they sat on it, and then it just fell in. Okay. Okay. It ain't unsafe to go down there. I mean, there ain't no water around that. You can hear it rushing like a river down there in the thingville. Okay, so you're going to go to Lakeshore M89 and wait then? Is that what you're saying, Larry? Well, how long do it take to get to 34 shell, M89 and Blue Star? I'm going to try and get you somebody as soon as I can, sir. How long? What are they? I can't give you an ETA. I'm going to try and get somebody to you as soon as I can. Five minutes? What? I can't give you an ETA, Larry. I'm going to try and get somebody to you as soon as I can. I'd rather you wait at the M89 shell there for an officer. Toby, um, Toby, tell, well, if you're going to take 10, 15 minutes and they're down there frickin' drowning or something. Okay, one second, Mary. Okay, don't hang up. Who are you talking to? Don't, don't, don't tell her to stay home, though. You don't need her getting out of here in the water, too. Being flooded everywhere, you know. Hey, you got any fast-paced? Man, we think nothing, spotlight something, man. We think Dean and Dean went down Lakeshore and the road fell in. We think they fell into this thing down there. We called 911. They're dragging ass about getting somebody out here. They ain't got no other papers down Lakeshore. We need some lights, man. Yes, the road is flat gone. The newspapers leave right up to that spot. There's a tree right on the other side. Like, maybe they stopped and the road gave out from under them. They ain't done no boxes past that point. And we cannot find it. If they broke down and tore up or anything, they had two phones on them. Dean had a different type of branch, like a centennial in his pocket, and Dean had her next phone. We can't get her out of either one of them. Lakeshore, man, you take M89 down to, you don't want Lakeshore there, you head south on Lakeshore. And when you get there, yeah. Okay, so you have two of them. of your mail carriers that are, they are out this morning? They're delivering the newspapers. The Grand Rapids Express. No, hold on. I'm talking to the police officer. Yes, I am. I'm at the show. They were delivering newspapers, Sunday newspapers. They have two phones on them. Dean has a Centennial in his pocket. Dean had her All-Tel. Okay. Her Nextel. So they had two different types of phones and fully charged phones. Okay. Okay. Other than not being able to get a hold of them on their phone, there's no other reason for you to think that something bad happened to them, correct? No, yes. The, um, there ain't no newspapers past that point. Larry, listen to me a second, all right? The roads are really bad. They delivered newspapers. You can watch the mailboxes all the way to death. Okay. But you said that the road was... washed out there, correct? Yes. So they couldn't go past that point, right? Nope. So they wouldn't be able to deliver newspapers past that point if there's no more there, correct? Okay, listen, no. I get what you're getting at, but the road dead ends. They would turn, right after that spot, they would do one more box. The road would dead end, and they would turn around, come back down Lake Shore, pass up to 99, and start again. But you don't see where the vehicle had gone off the road or anything like that, right? No. Okay. Where are you waiting right now? Well, y'all are taking forever, so we're going to be at 21817 Lakeshore. 2817. 2817 Lakeshore. Okay. We're doing the best that we can, and like I said, we'll get someone out to you, and like my partner told you, we'll get someone out to you as soon as we can. Okay, we're going down there. Bye.

I have a young girl here who is mauled by a bear and is in pretty bad shape, so we need paramedics. Okay. I'm going to transfer you through to the medics, or did you guys already talk to the medics? I have not talked to anybody yet. Okay. Where are you guys? Okay. To access us, the easiest access would be to go to the Hilltop Sea area. and goes down what is called the Gas Line Trail to where it meets Campbell Creek. There is a trail. So you're closest to Hilltop? Hilltop Ski Area, yes. Into the actual ski area. There's a trail. You can drive all the way down. Okay, hold on one second. Okay, now that I've got kind of where you are, I need to transfer you through to the medics, okay? Okay, thank you. Can you still hear me? Yes, I can. Okay, hold on one second.

Fire paramedics, what's the location of the emergency? You want the location of the emergency? Yes. It is on what is called Rover's Run Trail, and the best way to access that is by the gas line trail, which begins... Okay. What's the problem, Tom? Exactly what happened? Okay. I just came across a young girl who was mauled by a bear. She is... I'm going to ask you some questions about her while my partner gets help started. We do have calls on this. I just need to get some better patient information. How old is she? I believe she's about... 15, 16 years old. All right. I'm just confirming. Is she conscious? She is conscious. Is she breathing? She is breathing heavily, yes. Just a couple more questions for her while my partner gets help started. Hold on one second. When did this happen? I would say within the last probably 15 to 20 minutes would probably be accurate. Is there any serious bleeding? Yeah, severe bleeding. All right. Are you with her right now? I am, and we're in close proximity. to where it happened, which is maybe... What kind of injuries does she have? It's hard to tell because it's dark enough, and I dropped my bike down the trail. I don't have a light. All right. Is there any animal? Is the attacker... Is the animal still nearby? Not that I know of. I hope it's gone away, but... All right. How far are you in from Campbell Airstrip Road? Okay. Campbell Airstrip Road, you would... If you came up Campbell Airstrip Road, you would access us by the... Bivouac Trailhead. Say that trailhead one more time. Okay, the South Bivouac Trailhead. And you have to go down the trail to Campbell Creek. And on the opposite side of Campbell Creek, there's a trail called Rover's Run that parallels the creek. There's a small footbridge and there's a main bridge just up from there. Sir, listen, we understand that. We got somebody at the We need to know about how far in are you, about a quarter mile? Okay, what trailhead are you at? We're going to come in off the South Bivouac Trailhead, just like you said. Okay. Our first caller gave us that information is waiting up there for us. Okay, go in the trailhead, and there will be, if you, are you guys going to drive a vehicle in? I don't know if they're going to be able to drive a vehicle in or not. I'm not out there, sir. Okay, if you go in the trailhead, I would say about 100 yards down the trail, there is a right-hand turn, and it goes down a steep dirt trail. Okay. You go down a steep dirt trail, which then takes you right to Campbell Creek. There's a footbridge that crosses Campbell Creek. Okay. Go across the footbridge, and we are on a trail that parallels the creek on the opposite. And after you go across the footbridge, you turn to the right. Okay. And just walk down it about 100 yards. You'll see two bikes on the trail, and we're just a little ways down from that. Okay. You have somebody up there. Yeah, we're going to keep you on the phone because there's supposedly somebody out there at the road who's going to direct us down there. But we're going to pass this information on. You're doing good, Patrick. You're doing awesome. You're just fine. You're really fine. It's scary, but that's all it is, okay? All right, does she have any serious bleeding? No. Yes, I would say so. Okay, what I want you to do is get a clean, dry cloth or towel, place it on the wound, press it down firmly, and do not lift it up to look. I don't know exactly where the wound is, is the problem. All right. Can you ask her where she thinks she's hurt? Do you know where you're hurt? Sir, listen. Yeah. I got a quick question. Okay. How close are you to the Campbell Airstrip? To the Campbell Airstrip. We're much farther than the actual Airstrip. I understand. Okay, very good. So if we're up at, or if we're on, the engine company that's out there right now, they're at the access to the Camel airstrip. Okay, they want to go up. They need to go farther up the road? They need to go farther up the road to where there's a trailhead on either side of the road. They're right next to each other. One is north, trailhead goes towards. Okay, so they need to go farther up the road. How far up the road from the access to the Camel airstrip? I would say a mile and a half, two miles, something like that. And there will be two very obvious trailheads with big wooden signs. Okay, so it's marked? Yeah. So they're marked north and south? Yeah, and they want to go in the south Dibwack Trailhead. Get in there. Get in there. going to go down the trail about 50 or 100 yards. Okay. They're going to look to their right. Okay. There's a steep dirt trail that you can walk down. Okay. You walk down that towards the creek, which we'll see. There's a footbridge that crosses the creek, and you cross the creek, and then you immediately take a right onto a very obvious trail, and they should probably have a gun or bear protection, too. Okay. Yeah, well, we're getting the cops to come out there with us, so. Okay. Okay. You're doing good, Pedro. Keep it up. You're doing great. But you're okay. Are you still with me? Okay, yeah, I'm still here. No, I'm talking to the girl here. Hey, bear. Stay with bear. Is the bear there? Not that I know of, but, you know, there's a lot. I hear you. Do you know what kind of bear it was? I don't, no. Pedro, you're doing so good. You're doing awesome. Just relax. Is she breathing regularly? Yeah, but I would say heavy breathing. She's very much conscious, but, you know. Doing good. Do you know where you are? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Can you hear anybody out there? No. You know, there's a good chance that someone will be through any time now because there's a bike race, a 24-hour race going on, and bikers will be coming through. Okay. If you see somebody pass by, I want you to stop them. I'll have them go up and flag them. Yes. The light is on on my bike. If they look down, once they kind of make the turn into the trail, they'll kind of see it. Hey, can you stop, please? Who is that? Okay. She was attacked by a bear. We have the paramedics coming, but this is the issue. They're going to be coming into the South Bivouac Trailhead. Can you go up there and direct them down? I want you to yell and be as careful as you can because the bear is obviously still in the proximity. You got it. There's like four more coming for you. Okay. Okay. Just make a lot of noise. Pedro, you're doing awesome. You're doing so good. Still there? Can you not? Okay. Okay. Awesome. Are you guys still there? We're still here. Okay. We're letting them know right now that you're sending somebody down. He's going to go right up to the south of the Black Trailhead, and he'll direct them down. It's a little bit of a hike down, but it's not... It's not that big of a deal. Okay. How's she doing? She seems doing extremely well. It's, you know, she's still conscious. She can move a little bit. All right. Can you tell now where the bleeding's coming from? So you don't know where you got hurt, do you? Okay. No, just, yeah, it's crazy, but I just can't tell. It looks like she might have got rolled around in the dirt quite a bit by the bear. Okay. Here, Pedro, hold my hand, okay? Just hold it right here. Okay. You're doing awesome. You're going to be fine if you're just hanging there. In a couple minutes, you'll be getting cleaned up. It's feeling way better. Got it. You're doing good. Tell me if you... Tell me if you start to hurt more. Something happens, I guess. We're still here. Okay. Can you see? Are you looking ahead? Okay, okay. Just keep relaxing. We don't want her to move around unless she's in danger. Okay, okay. Should we don't splint any injuries? Yeah. I moved us about 50 feet from where the attack was because I just, yeah. I figured that was probably constituted a danger, but, you know, I don't know. Oh, don't move. Don't move if you don't have to, please. Okay, Pedro? Okay. You're doing awesome. You're doing so good. I think someone's going to be here any minute now. Doing great. Do we have any word on this spaceometer yet? They're on location. They're responding on location right now. There's And we've got that other biker going up there, so that'll be good. Yep. OK. You're doing awesome. OK. We'll all be over pretty soon. This is APD. About how many miles up Campbell Air Strip Road is the trailhead? If they were at the Campbell Airstrip trailhead, I would say I don't have to choose something else, but I don't entirely know. It's not very up. If they start going up a steep cave climb, are you okay, Phaedra? If they start going up the hill and it's like a big up, then they've gone past it. A big what? If they start going like really way up in an extended climb, if If it starts to really climb uphill, then they've gone past it. We've got another risk coming. Hey, can you stop? Is that another biker? Yeah. Can you come here, please? Who is that? Okay. Can you hang with me? Yeah. Okay. We have a bear attack. So maybe if he can just hang out here. I sent Will up to the south. Okay. Okay. You're okay, Pedro. You're okay. Okay. So, help me flag people into here. That's our main concern. Hello? Okay. It sounds like they might be coming. I'm not sure. Who do you see coming? Right here. Who's here? Okay. Are the paramedics coming? Yeah. Okay. Okay. It sounds like they're on their way. Who are you talking to? Oh, a couple other bikers just showed up. Okay. We don't know where the bleeding come from. We're just going to hold her in place. Who did they talk to? Who are the two bikers talking to, though, that came up? Oh, are you a paramedic? Okay. Is that the paramedics that are on location right now? Yeah, we have EMT here right now. No, there's an Anchorage Fire Department EMT. Are you a fire department? No. Uh, no. Okay, so when they said they had paramedics, they met the paramedics. There's somebody there at the trailhead. Can they confirm that, that somebody's up at the trailhead to meet us? can't confirm that. What we're concerned about is... Okay, hold on just a moment here. I'm sorry. The trail that you're on, this is what I need to know. The trail that you're on is not accessible by a vehicle. Is that correct or not? Yes, that is correct. They'll need a board. It's a foot trail only. Yes, that's correct. Okay, so they need to come down the south bivouac, go across the footbridge, and then take a right and go down the trail that parallels Campbell Creek. Yep, yeah. And that's called Rover Trail. Yes, it's called Run Rover Trail. And there's a gentleman that's up there to kind of flag him in. Okay. Well, I'm thinking that he already met them. They should be on their way in there shortly. Okay, okay, good. We're going to keep you on the phone until we get there. Yeah, yeah, I'll stay on the phone. We do have an EMT on the scene, so. And we've got a couple people here now, so. Adrian, you're doing awesome. Doing good. It'll be all over soon. How's she doing? She's doing great. Her breathing slowed down a little bit. It's just because she's calming down. Do you still have a clean, dry closet? Can you find out where the bleeding is from now? I mean, since she's calmed down a little bit, can you ask her where she thinks she got bit? I've asked her three times. She still doesn't know. We have an EMT, and he's starting to kind of take off some clothing and do searching. All right. Well, if they find anything, just let me know. It looks like a puncture wound to the face, and I think that may be where a lot of the blood is from. Okay. A little bit of left eye trauma. It looks like a puncture wound or a little trauma to the inner thigh, but it's not bleeding. It doesn't look like it hit an artery or anything. Okay. unless she is in danger. Okay, yeah. Because you're not sure what type of other injury she may have suffered when she was attacked. Right, I understand, I understand. We're not moving her. We're trying to keep her as still as possible. Okay, all right. Hey, Joe, you're doing great. This is APD. Do you know what type of air it is? You know, it's dark, so I seriously doubt that she was able to identify what that parrot was. Okay. You're doing so good. Just relax. You're in good hands. Okay, Pedro, the medics have met Will up at the top of the road. They're going to be down here. Good job. Okay, I mentioned that to the medic. Is this the APD or the medic? Both of us are on the phone. Oh, okay, okay. And I think I mentioned that there is a puncture wound to the inner thigh. Yes, you have. And also one kind of on the quadricep OCD. It looks like above the knee. It looks like kind of a similar wound. OK. Because you're doing awesome. And will I give them, will I ask them, or should I give the phone to a medic? No, they'll be able to help her. Okay, okay. Once they're on location with her, just let me know and then I'll hang up with you. You're doing a good job. Okay, yeah, she's starting to have a little trouble breathing. Okay. Do you think it's because she's in pain or? I think there may, she's got a lot of pressure right on my leg there. I just, I wonder if that's going to hurt her ribs. Remember, we don't want her moving. Keep her in the same position that she's in. Okay, we had to move her on her side. She kind of has rolled over on her side. There seems to be a little bit of a puncture wound maybe in the throat area. I think she's starting to struggle to breathe a little bit at the moment. All right, let me know if anything changes with her. Okay, she's... She's breathing more rapidly now. Okay. Just pretty sure that we have help on the way for her and that the medics are coming. Okay, Jo, I know it hurts. Just relax. The medics are on their way. They're going to be here in just seconds. Just relax. Okay, I think she's okay. Okay. officers escorting the medics in right now. Okay, okay. They have some police coming in with the medics because they're concerned about the barren area. Can I get your name, sir? My name is Pete Gassinger. All right, thank you. We also just located a kind of a wound, located wound, kind of a rather large, I would say, probably three inches long. I'm just confused. on these wounds under applying pressure and are not lifting it up to look? Well, the EM is rinking the wound. They don't seem to be bleeding that bad. It's a facial wound that seems to be bleeding. OK. But just to let you know, there is a wound in her back, kind of above her left butt cheek. probably about three inches long, you know, and kind of into the meaty area there. It's not bleeding that bad, but it is, you know, a little bit dirty. Okay. You're an awesome patient. Just keep relaxing. We're going to get you all fixed up here. Okay. Is it the medics? The medics have arrived. They're with her. Okay. Excuse me. Is that the ASD medics? We have a fire department. And are the police with them too? Yeah, the police are here with guns and everything. Okay, I'm going to let you go so you can talk to them. Thank you for calling for her. Okay, thanks. Bye."

Okay, how far deep was the collapse in it, though? I mean, was it sinking into it, or? No, no, no, it's probably 10 yards into that, or 7 yards into that, where they walked in. Okay. Okay.

What is it you're calling about? All right, what's happened is pull up to the drawbridge, the light goes red. I think it's a malfunction because there's nothing happening on the drawbridge. Okay.

What there is is there's a red light, and then there's a drop gate with six blinking lights, and there's nothing going on. No bridge going up. Okay. Did you just call 911 after this? Yes. Okay, well, the office that you spoke to was just trying to simply state that 911 is used for emergencies only, not just because you're sitting in traffic. No, but this isn't traffic. This is a pretty serious malfunction. It's affecting a lot of... I understand what you're saying. There's nobody dead or killed, but I'm just saying... It's just creating backup, correct?

No, I'm just... I didn't mean to cut you off. All right, well, who do I... I mean, do we just sit here indefinitely while this bridge malfunctions? Honestly, sir, we have no control over the bridge. We happen to be... city that borders with the bridge right at the line. Right. But unfortunately, we have no control over that. You'd have to contact... I mean, I live in Alexandria. I'm not even on the darned Alexandria side. Maybe you can contact VDOT or Maryland's Department of Transportation, but unfortunately, I don't have any answers for you as to why the bridge is stopped.

So there was a white male, a white female, and a Mexican male? Yes. And was he tall or was he like average? No, he was like. He was almost six-something. He was tall also.

Do you have any dogs, anything in the house? There was a couple of dogs, but I think they went out when the door opened. Okay. Okay, they are coming lights and sirens. We have units in the area, okay, but I want you to stay on the line with me until we have someone with you. We are, we're coming, okay, we are coming. Ma'am, last Saturday I got in a fight with a girl and I think maybe she has something to do with it. Okay. Now, I mean, was there any, like, drugs mentioned, or were they just looking for money? I couldn't tell. They just said, hurry up and get what we need, but, I mean, we don't have drugs or anything like that in this house. Do you think maybe it was a mistake, or do any of your neighbors have anything? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Oh, my God. There's so much pain. Yeah. And in which leg it was shot? My right, my right. Your right leg, okay. And it's falling. Yeah, keep some pressure on it, okay? I'm just trying to hold it. I have to kill my husband now. What am I going to do? I don't know, honey. We'll get somebody out there for you, and they'll help you through this, okay? And the gun that you said they left behind, is that a handgun? Ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh, my God. That gun that they left behind, that's a handgun, right? It looks like a shot-off shotgun or something. Okay. And you didn't touch it, right? No, I can't move, ma'am. Okay, that's good. Don't touch it. As soon as I thought they had left, and I think she came back because they forgot the gun, and I jumped up, too. My husband's always had a gun in the house just in case. And that's good that you knew how to use it. Did you hit any of them or any of them wounded, you know? No, ma'am. Was that you shooting that I heard also? No, he was shooting at me. He was shooting at you? And you don't think you hit any of them? No. Okay. Did you shoot off any rounds from your gun? Yes. Okay. Oh, my God, ma'am. How many shots do you think you shot off? I don't know. Whatever you heard. Okay. So was that only you shooting or did they shoot two? No, they were shooting two. Okay. Oh, my God. Okay. And now, did you hear any vehicle speed off after they left this last time? I just heard some doors shut. You heard doors shut, but that was it? Okay. They should be in the area. I think what they're doing right now is just checking the area, but I'm trying to convince them to get someone to you okay. So there should be, there's multiple units hanging there. They have like the whole army coming towards you, okay? I need to lay down, ma'am. I'm sorry. That's fine. Lay down, but take the phone with you, okay? Keep me on the line so you can keep me updated on how you're doing. Is your daughter still crying? No, she's, I think she's gone now. Okay. And you're not expecting anybody, right? No family members are coming to visit, anything like that? No, no, it's too darn late so that we were sleeping. Okay. Did it sound like they have any accents of any kind? Were they speaking like normal English, like you and me? The two first ones came and were speaking English to us, and we were asking what's going on, and they were telling us, you don't have the right to ask any questions right now. We need to check your health for this, this, this, and this. And my husband's like, why do you have tape on your gun? And that's why they shot him. Oh, okay. Did you notice they took anything? Oh, okay. No, no, I mean before when they first came in. No. Okay. How are you doing? Are you holding up okay? I understand what you just went through. I don't mean to ask that in that sense, but is your leg, are you okay? Okay. the male shot your husband? Yes. Okay. Was it the white male or the Hispanic male? So was there another one besides the three suspects that you told me about? No. Hold on now. There was a lot of them, but the ones you saw, there was the white, the Hispanic, and the female? I don't know right now. I don't know. Okay. I need you to think. I need you to help just kind of focus on what I'm saying to you and try and answer the questions. I know your leg hurts. I understand that your families were shot, but I need you to answer these questions so we can help catch these people, okay? I just need you to think just to keep your mind off of what's going on, okay? If you had to estimate, how many people would you say? Four or five. Four or five, and were they male and then that one female? Yeah. Okay. Are they all wearing camouflage? I only saw the three. Only saw the three. Okay. And you're in the kitchen? Mm-hmm. Okay. And you can't think of anyone that would want to hurt you or your family? Mm-hmm. You don't have any family? Can you do me a favor? What's that? Can you call my mom and dad? Yeah. What room is your husband and your daughter in? They're right here next to me. They're in the kitchen also? In the living room. Oh, because you're in the living room now? No, they're in the living room. I ran to the kitchen to get the gun. Okay, so are you, is it like your kitchen and your living room connected? Are they on their way? Yeah, yeah, they're in the area. They're right there. I'm really afraid that some people are going to come back. Yeah, they should be right there because they're asking you where you are and where your husband and your daughter are. Tell them it's safe to come inside. Nobody's in here. Okay. Wow, my legs are going to hurt really bad. Yeah. You heard me yelling at them, right? Yeah, I heard a couple shots, and then I heard you yelling saying, you said, get out, or I'm going to shoot you kind of thing, and then I heard more shots. Is that going to be held against me? No, this is self-defense. You're going through a traumatic event. Dude, I wouldn't expect anything unless... And it's good that you got it on tape. I mean, everything... Because you're telling them, you're telling them to get out. And this was after the shots were fired. And I don't know if you shot first. I don't know what happened. But everything that I could hear is on the recording. I'm sorry this is taking so long. I'm sure it seems like a lifetime. Can you remember anything about the people that you saw that would make them stand out? She's really short and fat, and he was really super tall, and he was a big guy. Okay. Were they wearing any masks, anything? No, his face is painted black. The white guy? Mm-hmm. And was he the only one that had the painted face? Mm-hmm. Okay. Should I know him? The female that you saw and the other male that you saw, they didn't have black faces? No. Okay. I only saw the lady. I didn't see the other person that came in. Okay. So the female's face wasn't painted black? No. Could you tell what color hair she had? Did she have a hat on? I didn't even care to. Okay. No, I understand. I'm just asking you questions. Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening. And I am so sorry for this. How the heck does this stuff happen? Nobody ever has a reason for these things. I'm like, I've never heard of any of this stuff happening in Arrow Vodka. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely new to me. I haven't heard of anything like this either. I wonder if they stole my vehicles outside as well. Okay. Can you tell me the best way to get to your house? Just go down Mesquite Road where the community center has come all the way down. All the way down to the end, all the way southbound? I don't know, ma'am. I don't know. Okay. Are you right there at the corner of Hardstrabble and Mesquite? Yes. Okay. Do you have a fence around your property at all? Yeah, my lights are all on, though. Okay. So the fence, is it just your front yard or the back yard? No, it's just the front yard. And you're right there on the corner. There's no other trailers or anything on the property. I hear somebody pulling up. Is that them? No, that should be them. Let me double check, though, okay? Do you see any flashing lights, anything like that? Huh? Do you see any flashing lights? I can't get up. Okay. You don't see anything like reflecting off the house or anything? Okay. They should announce themselves, like when they're coming in, they should say. They're pulling out, really fast. They're pulling out, like they're leaving? Yeah. Can you see what's going on? Hold on, I need to get the gun. Yeah, yes, get the gun. Are you up? Are you walking? No. Are you crawling? Okay, so you're still in the same place you were? Okay. Somebody came and took off now. Is it like gravel on the gravel? You could hear the gravel? I can hear the dirt. The dirt, okay. And you didn't hear any doors open or shut or anything like that? Are you hearing anything right now? Okay. I'm hearing cars driving crazy outside. Yeah, there's lots of deputies coming their way, so I'm hoping it's one of them. Do you hear a lot of movement outside? Yeah, I hear cars are turning back and forth. But you can't see outside? Uh-oh. Does it sound like they're speeding? Yeah. Okay, we do have units there. Keep me on the line, okay, until there's someone with you. You're sure it's them? I'm sure it's them. My dispatcher just told me that someone's there now. And they have border patrol with them, okay? Okay. should be coming into the house. They're going to announce, and more than likely, they're going to clear the property. So if you hear people coming in, let me know, okay? Okay, can you please call my family now? Yeah, I put their name and number in the call, so that's going to get done. Oh, and they locked the gate, and they can't get in. I hear them trying to open it. The gate's locked? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if they might have locked the gate when they left, and they get harder to get in. Please tell them to hurry. Yeah. Put your hands up and put the gun down, okay? They're yelling at me. Put your hands up and put the guns down. I can't get up. No, no, you don't have to get up. What I want you to do is I want you to put the gun down. Okay. Put it away from you. I'm in here, sir. I'm in here. Tell them you can't move. I'm here in the kitchen on 911, sir. I'm right here.

Okay. So you heard me yelling at them, right? Yeah, I heard a couple shots, and then I heard you yelling, saying, you said, get out, or I'm going to shoot you, kind of thing, and then I heard more shots. Is that going to be help against me? No, this is self-defense. You're going through a traumatic event. Dude, I wouldn't expect anything less. And it's good that you got it on tape. I mean, everything. Because you're telling them to get out. And this was after shots were fired. And I don't know if you shot first. I don't know what happened. But everything that I could hear is on the recording. I'm sorry, this is taking so long. I'm sure it seems like a lifetime. Can you remember anything about the people that you saw that would make them stand out? She's really short and fat, and he was really super tall, and he was a big guy. Okay, were they wearing any masks, anything? No, his face is painted black. The white guy? No. Was he the only one that had the painted face? Mm-hmm. Okay. Because I know him. So like the female that you saw and the other male that you saw, they didn't have black faces? No. Okay. I only saw the lady. I didn't see the other person that came in. Okay. So the female's face wasn't painted black? No. Could you tell what color hair she had? Did she have a hat on? I didn't even tell. Okay. No, I understand. I'm just asking you questions. Oh, my God. And I'm so sorry for this. How the heck does this stuff happen? Nobody ever has a reason for these things. I'm like, I've never heard of any of this stuff happening in Arrow Vodka. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely new to me. I haven't heard of anything like this either. I wonder if they stole my vehicles outside as well. Can you tell me the best way to get to your house? Just go down the street road where the community center has come all the way down. All the way down to the end, all the way southbound? I don't know, ma'am. I don't know. Okay. Are you right there at the corner? Okay. Do you have a fence around your property at all? Yeah, my lights are all on, though. Okay. So the fence, is it just your front yard or the backyard? No, it's just the front yard. And you're right there on the corner. There's no other trailers or anything on the property. I hear somebody pulling up. Is that them or something? It's scary. No, that should be them. Let me double check, though, okay? Do you see any flashing lights, anything like that? Huh? Do you see any flashing lights? I can't get up. Okay. You don't see anything like reflecting off the house or anything? Uh-uh. Okay. They should announce themselves, like when they're coming in, I should say. They're pulling out, Lily. They're pulling out, like they're leaving? Yeah. Can you see what's going on? Hold on, I need to get the gun. Yeah, I need to get the gun. Are you up? Are you walking? No. Are you crawling? Okay, you're still in the same place you were? Okay. Is it like gravel? You could hear the gravel? I can hear the dirt. The dirt, okay. And you didn't hear any doors open or shut or anything like that? Are you hearing anything right now? Okay. I'm hearing cars driving crazy outside. Yeah, there's lots of deputies coming your way, so I'm hoping it's one of them. Do you hear a lot of movement outside? Yeah, I hear cars are starting back and forth. Oh, you can't see outside? Uh-oh. Does it sound like they're speeding? Yeah. Okay, we do have units there. Keep me on the line, okay, until there's someone with you. You're sure it's them? I'm sure it's them. My dispatcher just told me that someone's there now. And they have Border Patrol with them, okay? Okay. Should be coming into the house. They're going to announce, and more than likely, they're going to clear the property. So if you hear people coming in, let me know, okay? Okay, can you please call my family now? Yeah, I put their name and number in the call, so that's going to get done. Oh, and they locked the gate, and they can't get in. I hear I'm trying to open it. The gate's locked? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if they might have locked the gate when they left, and they get harder to get in. Please come over here. Yeah. Put your hands up and put the gun down, okay? They're yelling at me. Put your hands up and put the guns down. I can't get up. No, no, you don't have to get up. I just want, what I want you to do is I want you to put the gun down. Okay. Put it away from you. I'm in here, sir. I'm in here. Tell him you can't move. He's here in the kitchen on 911, sir. I'm right here, and there's a gun. Is he with you? Yeah, he's with me. Okay, I'll let you go. Okay. All right, bye-bye. Bye-bye."

She says he's cold and he's not breathing. She says she's been trying to give him CPR. Okay. Is there any way you can get a phone, a cell phone, or something over there to him? Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, I'm giving it to her right here. Here she is, right here. Okay. About a year ago, they text police to stop him in the middle of the night going up toward Raleigh. Hello, ma'am? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Can you get in there with him? Yes. I've been there trying to do mouth-to-mouth, but he's cold and stiff. Really cold and stiff. And I've been gone all day hunting for him because he's got a lot of mental problems and he likes to go down to Durham and Raleigh. And he was picked up, well, wasn't picked up, but he was stopped by the Apex police about a year ago because it was like 4 in the morning and he was out there.

So I came over here because it finally dawned on me I wasn't getting anywhere with it, and he just got colder, so I... Okay. I've been hunting for him all last night and all day. I haven't had any sleep. He's been doing these things for six years since he got to live home. Okay. Last year you were over there with him, was he awake? No, he was as cold as a bone. Was he breathing? No, he's stiff and cold as a bone. And I went and blew in his mouth and nothing happens because his chest don't rise or nothing because he's already cold. Okay. Do you think he's beyond any help? Oh, God, yes. Okay. I've never seen a dead person outside of a coffin. Okay. And then I had to put my mouth on his, and it was so cold, and he's got his teeth all knocked out, and he's all beat up looking. His teeth are knocked out, and he's beat up looking? Yes, because he hangs out. Sometimes he goes down to Rowland, Durham, and he walks. And one time a year ago, the Apex cops saw him at 4 in the morning heading toward Raleigh, and they stopped him and talked to him, and he said, is there a law against me walking down the street at 4 in the morning? And they said, well, no. And he said, well, I'm not a window peeper or nothing, and can't I be on my way? And they said, yes. Jolene, when's the last time you saw him? I saw him early this morning, or not this morning, yesterday morning. and then he took off somewhere evidently that evening. When's the last time you were home? The last time I was home. Yes, ma'am. I've been out all night looking for him and all day looking for him. Okay. And I got at my house about 3, I'm guessing about 3.30. 3.30 this morning? No, no, this afternoon. Okay. Before 3.30 this afternoon, when's the last time you were physically home? At what time? When is the last time you were home inside? Yes. The last time I was home. Uh-huh. I was home once early morning, and he wasn't there then. But when I come back now, he is. Okay, and you've been doing CPR since you came at 3.30? Okay. What's that? You've been doing CPR since you're 30? Yes, I have. But I got heart condition and high blood pressure and cholesterol, and I got sick of diabetes a little bit, and I couldn't breathe deep enough. But, I mean, he was already cold, so he's been laying there. He had to come home sometime in the morning time, you know, not early morning, but later morning, because I just went in there. Okay, is that the ambulance I hear pulling up? Yes, they're here. Go ahead and talk to them. Go talk to them. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye."

And the security guards here were saying that if they kept doing their... nonsense here that they were going to throw us out because it's a public place and you're not allowed to do something like that. What is your name? My name's Carlos. And I just think it's a violation of our right. Just go ahead and speak to the officer when he gets there, okay? Alright, thank you. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Señor, es que hace como 5 minutos hablé de aquí del chico Pastor Monwood. Sí, señor. No ha cambiado nada. No, todos están aquí, pero nomás quería saber si le dije cuál chico es porque son 5 chicos, era Monwood. Señor, sí, tengo la llamada y van a salir las unidades ahí al chico de Monwood. Ok. Marco Navas. Sí, Marco Navas soy yo. Sí, nomás quería saber, es que todos se pusieron agresivos. Sí, está, y hay un niño y está la familia y otras personas comiendo en un restaurante, señorita, ¿verdad? Sí, señor, ahí vamos a mandar la unidad, ¿ok? Ok, gracias por nada. Bye, bye. ¿Habla español? Sí, dígame. Hace como cinco minutos hablé con un operador hombre y le dije que soy el guardia de chicos tacos mongos. Estaban unas personas aquí besándose hombres entre ellos mismos, o sea, homosexuales, y yo les llamé la atención nomás de que no pueden estar haciendo eso aquí, ¿verdad? Y porque hay familia y hay gente. Entonces me dijeron, ¿me estás discriminando? Habla de la policía. Y me dijo, sí, le voy a dar a la policía, pero yo les dije bien, yo soy el guardia. Entonces llegó otra persona que como que la están esperando, y están esperando ellos a la policía, pero no ha llegado la patrulla, tenía como 10 minutos que hablé. He hablado dos veces, esta es la tercera. Por eso nomás la razón, la segunda hablé para decirles que era Mongu, porque dije, a lo mejor no me expliqué dónde era. Sí, aquí tenemos la llamada, nomás que las policías ahorita andan poco ocupadas, pero en cuanto se toque, le mandamos la policía para allá. Ok, muy amable, gracias. De nada. Ok, bye bye. I'm sorry to bother you. I called right now about a complaint at Chicos Pacos on Mottwood and Treywood. Okay. Give me one second. You said Mottwood and Treywood? Yes, ma'am. They're going to close in a little bit. And we have a little issue here at the Chicos Pacos with the security guards. Okay. And we really need them to get over here. It looks like we do still have the call, and we'll be sending someone out as soon as possible. Is it going to take a walk because they do close in a little bit? It's really difficult for me to say, but I can assure that they will be there as soon as possible, especially with the weather. There's a lot of things going on tonight. I have a question for you. Sure. See, this is a thing. It's a bunch of guys hanging out. It's five of us, and two of them are gay. And we walked in. We all placed our order. And one guy reached over and gave the other guy a kiss on the lip, just like a peck on the lip. Uh-huh. The security guard came and said that they started telling him, if you guys keep up with your shit, we're going to kick you the fuck out, like cussing out us like that. Uh-huh. And I said, you know what, you're not allowed to tell us what we can do or not do. I mean, we're not doing anything crazy or anything, you know? Uh-huh. So I think that's a little like, it's like discrimination, no? Uh-huh. And it was, nobody's in the restaurant. Nobody was here. So that's why I called the police. Okay. And the security guards got really, really crazy with this. And we had to order our food and, you know, we're not even enjoying it. We're just waiting for the cops to show it. I called my parents. I called, one of my cousins is a sergeant in the police department. His name is in the kitchen denier queue. So we're a little bothered about it because it just ruined everything for us. What is your name? My name is Carlos. Your last name, Carlos? Diaz, D-I-A-Z. But I do think it's a little discrimination. He said, the security guard said, we don't allow girls to kiss or guys to kiss. Whatever you all do out of here is your business. But if you guys are doing that shit here, we're going to kick you the fuck out, blah, blah, blah. So, I mean, whether people like it or not, I think it's a little discrimination, no? Right. Well, sir, we do have all the information, and we're trying to get someone out there as soon as possible. And are they still combative towards you? Yeah, the security guards are. Not like the staff of the... Just the security guards? But it's just, you know, the rental costs that they have. Right. Right. Okay, Carlos, so we do have the call, and we're going to be sending someone out as soon as possible. If for any reason he becomes, you know, any more aggressive or combative, then go ahead and give us a call back, okay? Okay. Are you going to be waiting inside or outside? We're actually going to be waiting inside. What color shirt do you have on, Carlos? Well, I'm in a white shirt and khaki pants. My father just got here, too. He's in a gray shirt and a, like, charcoal pants. You're down there? I'm right here. What time? Your dad just got there? Yeah, my dad's here with a seat. I call him and call him the situation. My mother's trying to get a hold of my cousin, Enrique, to get over here. Okay, Carlos, we do have the call, and we'll be sending someone out as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye."

At the light from the new Leicester Highway? and I was in the West Lane, and now he just circled around, and he's behind me now.

He is right behind me. And he tried to get into your car, is that what you're saying? Yeah, he tried to pull me out of the truck, and now he is all up behind me.

Sorry, Julie Brown. What is your phone number? Uh... What's the guy look like that's in the truck? Big. He's got a goatee, dark hair with gray in it. I should have paid more attention.

It's still Patton, or what is it, 1923 that it turned into? Okay. Okay. It splits off several ways there, to 240, to downtown, or to 1923. So I need to know which way you split off and when. I'm on 1923. It's Patton Avenue. It just goes straight out. I don't know what else to call it. I didn't get on the freeway. I'm on the regular road. Okay, so you're still just on Patton. You could go to 970 Haywood Road. There's a substation there. 970 Haywood Road. Yes. That's where the library is. Fire station on Haywood Road. I know where there is one up in Inca in front of me. I think. Where the fire station is there anyway. In the Inca in front of you. No, he's right behind me still. I've seen that I think there's a fire station up ahead in front of me. It's the Inca fire station, or whatever they call it. I'm not sure what the name of it is, ma'am. Huh? I'm not sure what the name of it is. Otherwise, you can go to a public place, a restaurant or something, and stop where there's other people. Yeah. Well, he's definitely following me. Okay. Like I said, you have the option of getting off and going to somewhere. He's going to hit me. My God. Ma'am, I understand what you're saying. So you can either keep driving or you can get off somewhere where there's a lot of people. Can I get in a different lane and let him pass you or pull off somewhere? That's part that he won't. Okay.

He's trying, but he can't. He got stuck in traffic. Oh, no, God, he whipped around somebody. Oh, my God, where is he going? Oh, my God, he just stopped in the middle of the road. Oh, he's coming back. He's coming back. What am I supposed to do? Ma'am, I told you, you can get off and go somewhere very public where there's a lot of people to witness anything that would happen. I'm sitting in this parking lot. It's very public, so everybody can see me get killed. Ma'am, are you in the parking lot at Shoney's? Is that where you are? Yes. Stay in the car. Keep your doors locked. We've got an officer en route to you. And stay on the phone with us until the officer gets there. We can... And just let us know what you see him doing. Do we have his vehicle description? He turned in at the holiday, and he turned around, and he's coming back. Stay in your vehicle, ma'am. Keep your doors open. The man's coming back to Shoney's, whoever's dispatching. Does she know this person? He drove right by. Now he's turning at the next flight. He's just coming around the back way. Did he pass Shoney's and go away from you? I'm sorry, what? You said he turned around at the Holiday Inn and came back. Did he get back on the highway or did he stay on Patton? He got back onto Patton, and it looks like he's going back the way we just came. Okay. You just stay there. We've still got two officers en route. I want you to talk to them, okay? Okay. Thank you. Okay. Just stay on the phone with me until I get there. Sorry. That's fine. Just stay there until the officers get there. Stay on the phone with me. Is that her vehicle description? Yes. Thank you so much. Ma'am? Do you still see him? No. Okay. After he drove past, I haven't seen him since he was back down. Okay. I think he couldn't find me in the parking lot. Did you know this guy at all? No, not at all. I was in at that intersection, and I was pulling up to the light, and he just moved over. And I had to lock him up, and I honked my horn at him, and as soon as I did that, he just threw his driver's side door open and came at me. I locked my door. So it was kind of like road rage? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Family's in there. I just can't believe it. He just followed me all the way out here. Okay, it's okay right now. He's gone, so don't get upset again, all right? Huh? I'm sorry. I said, don't talk yourself into getting upset. He's gone now. If you could just stay calm before the officer gets there. Yeah. I'm, like, trying to stop shaking now. Right. Okay. Let me see. Yes. No, she's she needs to meet with the officer at Shawnee's. She's waiting. Okay, the officer's almost there to you, okay? Okay. I'm watching Barnes. If you see him, can you kind of flag him down? I mean, he'll be looking for your vehicle, but it might be easier if you see him flagging. Yeah, I hope this way pulled in between trucks, though, because he wouldn't see me. Today, when's the last time I ever honked my horn? Yeah, you have to be careful. There's all kinds of people out there. He just kind of drifted over, and I, you know, I missed him. You know, he's just, it's automatic. Well, it is, and you have to let him know that you're there. Sometimes get his attention that way, but just don't, you know, continue to follow each other when it happens. Oh, God, no, I didn't follow him at all. He just was in front of me, and then he looked around behind me, driving up on me and stuff. Right. When he jumped out, I locked my door. I was like, what are you doing? Right, right, yeah. And then he followed me all the way out here. God. Click on the map so you can see where he is. Got his attention. Are you okay to hang up with me now? Are you okay to hang up with me now? Yes. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. Bye."

And when I had looked, I went further closer to the house a little bit after the gentlemen were already in the house. I noticed two suitcases. So I'm not sure if these are two individuals who actually work there, I mean, who live there. Do you think they might have been breaking? I don't know, because I have no idea. I just noticed... Do you think the possibility might have been there? What do you mean by botched in? Did they kick the door in? No, they were pushing the door in, like the screen part of the front door was kind of like... How did they open the door itself with the lock? I didn't see a key or anything because I was a little bit away from the door, but I did notice that they... And what do these two cases have to do with anything? I don't know. I'm just saying that's what I saw. Do you know what apartment they broke into? No, they're just the first floor. I don't even think that it's an apartment. It's 17 Ware Street. It's a house.

They're still in the house, I believe, yeah. Are they white, black, or Hispanic? Well, there were two larger men. One looks kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure. And the other one entered, and I didn't see what he looked like at all. I just saw her from a distance, and this older woman was worried, thinking, someone's breaking in someone's house, they've been barging in. And she interrupted me, and that's when I had noticed. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have noticed it at all, to be honest with you. So I was just calling because she was a concerned neighbor, I guess. Okay. Are you standing outside? I'm standing outside, yes. All right, well, please on the way. You can meet them when they get there. What's your name? Yeah, my name is... All right, we're on the way. Okay.
